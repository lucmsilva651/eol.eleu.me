    <p>Dear users,
    <p>It is with regret that I announce the closure of this project. This decision was not easy, but it was made after careful consideration of the circumstances. Unfortunately, I have encountered significant challenges that make it impossible to continue offering this project.</p>
    <p>One of the main reasons for the closure is the low bandwidth limit that I am constrained by. Despite my efforts to find viable solutions, I have been unable to overcome this obstacle..</p>
    <p>Additionally, I have also faced difficulties in terms of the support and assistance necessary to maintain my project running effectively. Without adequate support, it has become increasingly challenging to uphold the quality and reliability of this.</p>
    <p>I would like to take this opportunity to offer sincere apologies to all users/visitors. I recognize that you may have placed your trust in me and invested time and resources into my project, and I deeply regret any inconvenience this decision may cause.</p>
    <p>I immensely appreciate the support and dedication of each and every one of you over the time. Without you, my journey would not have been possible. Although I am closing this chapter, I hope our paths may cross again in the future.</p>
    <p>Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns. I am here to assist in any way I can during this transition.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Lucas Gabriel (lucmsilva).</p>
